# üöÄ Multimodal RAG Playground

## Compare GPT-OSS with Leading Open Source LLMs  
**GPT-OSS vs Qwen3, Phi-4, LLaMA 3.1, Gemma 3**

---

## üìñ Project Description
**Multimodal RAG Playground** is an interactive application that allows you to **benchmark and compare multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)** side-by-side in a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** setup.  

With this tool, you can:
- üìÑ Upload PDF documents for semantic indexing  
- üîç Ask context-aware questions about your documents  
- ü§ñ Get parallel responses from **GPT-OSS, Qwen3, Phi-4, LLaMA 3.1, and Gemma 3**  
- üìä Evaluate results in a **side-by-side comparison view** for accuracy, reasoning, and style  

Built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, **BAAI BGE embeddings** (Hugging Face), and **Ollama** for running local LLMs, the app is designed for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts who want to explore how different models perform on the same task.

## üí° Use Cases
- **Model Benchmarking** ‚Äì Compare multiple open-source LLMs in a consistent RAG pipeline  
- **Research & Evaluation** ‚Äì Study differences in accuracy, reasoning style, and creativity  
- **Custom Playground** ‚Äì Easily add any LLM by updating the `model_configuration` list  
- **Local AI Testing** ‚Äì Run models locally with **Ollama** or connect to hosted APIs

## üß∞ Technologies Used

| Technology | Description | Link |
|------------|-------------|------|
| **LangChain** | A powerful framework for building applications with LLMs, providing modular tools like retrievers, chains, memory, and agents. Used here to orchestrate the RAG pipeline and handle model interactions. | [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) |
| **ChromaDB** | An open-source vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently, enabling semantic search and context retrieval in RAG workflows. | [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) |
| **BAAI BGE Embeddings** | High-quality embedding models from BAAI, hosted on Hugging Face, used for encoding documents into dense vector representations for similarity search. | [BAAI BGE on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) |
| **Streamlit** | A Python-based rapid app development framework for creating interactive web interfaces, used here to build the model comparison playground. | [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) |
| **Ollama** | A local model hosting and management tool for running open-source LLMs directly on your machine without external API calls. | [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) |
| **GPT-OSS, Qwen3, Phi-4, LLaMA 3.1, Gemma 3** | The set of LLMs benchmarked in this playground, covering both OpenAI's GPT-OSS and leading open-source models. | [OpenAI gpt-oss](https://ollama.com/library/gpt-oss) / [Llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1:8b) / [Gemma](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3)/ [Qwen3](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3)/ [Phi4](https://ollama.com/library/phi4:14b) |
| **Python** | The primary programming language used to develop the application, handle backend logic, and integrate all components. | [Python](https://www.python.org/) |
